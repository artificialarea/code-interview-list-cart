# What?

March 2025.
Revisiting my Rocket Travel coding interview exercise

Task(s):
- [ ] Parse the data
- [ ] Component #1: Inventory List via data 
    - (each list item with a button to add to shopping cart)
- [ ] Component #2: Shopping Cart List
- [ ] Functionality: if user adds inventory item to cart it should:
    - if not yet in the List: 
        - add item to list
    - if already in the list
        - update the quantity
    - update Total Price

... all within an hour.
